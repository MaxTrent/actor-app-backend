## Conventions to follow
- Run 'npm format' before push to organize code
- Confidential info; dbUrl, usernames, api credentials... should be in the .env

## Clean code
- Name classes and variables well
- Business logic should be separated from the controller, only application logic permitted
- Use early returns instead of nested conditions
- Write pure functions
